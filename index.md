NL+ is a weekly event to build community among faculty and students doing research related to NLP and to build ties with NLP researchers at other universities.

Roughly once a month, we host outstanding researchers from other universities (faculty and grad students) and industry to present their work.

Other weeks, a speaker from our own community present a short and informal talk followed by extended Q&A and discussion.

Meetings are usually on Wednesdays at 12:30pm over lunch.
