NL+ (**N**atural **L**anguage **P**rocessing **Lu**nch **S**eminar) is a weekly event at the University of Notre Dame to build community among faculty and students doing research related to NLP and to build ties with NLP researchers at other universities.

Our faculty sponsors are [David Chiang](https://www3.nd.edu/~dchiang), [Meng Jiang](https://meng-jiang.com), [Collin McMillan](https://www3.nd.edu/~cmc), [John Lalor](https://jplalor.github.io), and [Tim Weninger](https://www3.nd.edu/~tweninge/). Our amazing student organizers are Nick Botzer, [Sakib Haque](https://www.sakibhaque.com), [Darcey Riley](https://darcey.github.io), and [Wenhao Yu](https://wyu97.github.io).

Meetings are usually on Wednesdays at 12:30pm over lunch.
Roughly once a month, we host outstanding researchers from other universities (faculty and grad students) and industry to present their work.
Other weeks, a speaker from our own community presents a short and informal talk followed by extended Q&A and discussion.
