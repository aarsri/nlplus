I am a PhD candidate in David Chiang's natural language processing research group at the University of Notre Dame. My primary research focus is on incorporating simulations of nondeterministic pushdown automata into neural networks to improve machine learning on human languages. My interests lie generally in syntax, machine translation, and neural networks.
