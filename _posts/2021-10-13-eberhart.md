Sam Grieggs is a 4th year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Notre Dame. As a member of the Computer Vision Research Lab advised by Professor Walter Scheirer, his work focuses on utilizing artificial intelligence to aid in humanities research. Specifically, Grieggs works on historical document analysis, where he develops algorithms that can automatically read and transcribe Medieval Latin manuscripts, parse pages for content, and identify scribal hands. He measures human performance in tasks such as reading to develop training regimes for artificial neural networks that guide them in becoming human-like. Grieggs’s work also looks at how computer vision can assist humans in visual recognition tasks, as well as improving machine learning performance when unexpected data appears in practice.

Grieggs graduated from Indiana University of Pennsylvania in 2017 with a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics. He has interned at the Air Force Research Laboratory in Rome NY. As a graduate student, Grieggs is an Arthur J. Schmitt Leadership Fellow, and his work has been funded by the Department of Justice.
