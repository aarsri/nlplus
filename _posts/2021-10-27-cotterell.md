Bio:
I completed my undergraduate degree at Johns Hopkins University (also in Baltimore, Maryland) in Cognitive Science (with focal areas in Linguistics and Computational Methods) under the tutelage of Colin Wilson. I was then recruited by Jason Eisner to do a Ph.D. in Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University where I was a member of the Center for Language and Speech Processing; I also took quite a few courses in mathematics, statistics and linguistics along the way. I am currently a tenure-track assistant professor at ETH Zürich in the Department of Computer Science where I am a member of the Institut für maschinelles Lernen. I was previously a Lecturer (that’s British for tenure-track assistant professor) at the Computer Laboratory (the oldest computer science department in the world) at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom where I am still affiliated. I have also done research stints at Google AI, Facebook AI Research and the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich.
