Darcey is a 3rd year PhD student in the Computer Science and Engineering department, where she is advised by David Chiang. Her research focuses on probabilistic modeling for NLP. This includes work on factor graph grammars, a new class of models which uses graph grammars to generate probabilistic graphical models. More recently, she has been working on globally normalized alternatives to autoregressive language models.
