Bio:
I am a PhD student at the University of Notre dame advised by Dr. Collin McMillan in the software engineering lab. My aim is to make machines intelligent and smart ( yes, making them smart is harder!) to improve the quality of human life. I believe this will be the next step in our evolution, by design. My experience is varied across multiple disciplines towards this aim. I worked with Prof. Philip Evans  on automated medical imaging of hypoxic cancer cells while I earned my Masters in Computer Vision and Machine Learning at the University of Surrey with distinction.

My current research leverages the intersection of NLP and Software Engineering for code summarization and  program comprehension. My research is practical not theoretical, to that end I have also supervised human studies with medical patients and programmers.
