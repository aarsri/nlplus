Bio:
My goal is to enable reliable communication in natural langauge between machines and humans. Recent research directions include: (1) Text generation: How do we ensure that the generated text are not just coheret, but also factually correct? Beyond factuality, how do we generate novel, creative text in a controllable way? (2) Robust language understanding: Statistical machine learning systems suffer from spurious correlations in the data, resulting in biased prediction and catastrophic errors. How can we learn models that are robust to dataset biases? (3) Dialogue systems: Building an effective dialogue agent requires understanding in a broad sense, e.g., how to reason about structured knowledge and learn efficient strategies for a specific task?
