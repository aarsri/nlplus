Title: Towards reliable neural text generation

Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale neural language models have transformed the field of text generation, including applications like dialogue and document summarization. Despite human-like fluency, the generated text tends to contain incorrect, inconsistent, or hallucinated information, which hinders the deployment of text generation models in real applications. I will review observations of such errors in current generation tasks, explain challenges in evaluating and mitigating factual errors, and describe our recent attempts on addressing these problems. I will conclude with a discussion on future challenges and directions.
